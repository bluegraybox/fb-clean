# FB Clean

This is a Chrome browser extension to make Facebook less cluttered.
(And now MeWe.)

It adds vertical space between posts to make it easier to see where they start and end.
It also hides the comments for each post and adds a "Show/Hide" button to reveal them.

If you're not familiar with Chrome extensions, see the [installation instructions](install-docs/README.md).

_This is a fork of [Screen Clean](https://github.com/bluegraybox/screen-clean) with only the Facebook (and MeWe) styling._
